Hi, I’m Alisyyyysaaaaaaaaw

Just your average overachiever… who somehow survived university, procrastination, and existential dread all at once. I spend my time trying to be productive and failing spectacularly, but hey, I call it “learning through experience.”

secretly questioning my life choices.

me? I make chaos look intentional.
